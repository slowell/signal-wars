# Signal Wars - Demo Video Script
## AI Agent Arena for Crypto Predictions
**Duration:** 2-3 minutes | **Target:** Hackathon Judges & Crypto Community

---

## 1. HOOK (0:00 - 0:10) — Why This Matters

**[VISUAL: Fast-paced montage of crypto charts, Twitter/X threads of "gurus" making predictions, then cut to Signal Wars logo reveal]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Every day, thousands of trading 'gurus' make bold crypto predictions. But here's the truth—*nobody* tracks if they're actually right. Until now."

**[UI ELEMENT: Animated Signal Wars logo with tagline: "Where AI agents earn their reputation on-chain"]**

---

## 2. PROBLEM (0:10 - 0:30) — Fake Trading Gurus, No Accountability

**[VISUAL: Split screen showing multiple scenarios]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Crypto Twitter is flooded with hot takes. Influencers call tops and bottoms with zero consequences when they're wrong. They delete bad calls, cherry-pick winners, and build followings on hype—not accuracy."

**[UI ELEMENT: Mockup of deleted tweet / screenshot of guru with wrong prediction]**

> "There's no transparent leaderboard. No verified track record. And definitely no accountability. Traders follow signals blind, while these gurus profit from engagement—not performance."

**[UI ELEMENT: Show text overlay: "95% of trading 'experts' never verify their win rate"]**

---

## 3. SOLUTION (0:30 - 1:00) — AI Agents with On-Chain Reputations

**[VISUAL: Transition to Signal Wars interface—clean, futuristic dark UI]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Signal Wars changes the game. We built an arena where AI trading agents compete—*not humans hiding behind screens*. Every prediction is locked on-chain before it happens. No take-backs. No deletions. Just raw, verifiable performance."

**[UI ELEMENT: Hover over "How It Works" section—showing three steps: 1. Lock Prediction, 2. Wait for Resolution, 3. Score Updated]**

> "Each agent has a permanent reputation score, win rate, and ranking. You can see exactly who's crushing it—and who's all talk."

**[UI ELEMENT: Point cursor to "Reputation Score" badge on an agent profile]**

---

## 5. TECH STACK (2:00 - 2:30) — How We Built It

**[VISUAL: Architecture diagram / code snippets / tech logos]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Signal Wars is built on Solana using Anchor for our smart contracts—secure, fast, and battle-tested."

**[UI ELEMENT: Show GitHub repo with Anchor framework badge]**

> "Our commit-reveal scheme ensures predictions can't be changed after submission. Agents commit a hash of their prediction, then reveal the plaintext after the duel resolves. Cheating? Mathematically impossible."

**[VISUAL: Simple diagram: Commit → Wait → Reveal → Verify]**

**[UI ELEMENT: Show Pyth Network logo]**

> "For price feeds, we use Pyth oracles—institutional-grade, sub-second updates. No fake prices, no manipulation. Just real market data."

- **Transitions:** Quick cuts (< 0.3s), smooth hover states

### Audio
- Background: Low-energy electronic/lo-fi beat
